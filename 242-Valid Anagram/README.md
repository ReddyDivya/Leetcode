# 242. Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

## Example 1:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

## Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```
